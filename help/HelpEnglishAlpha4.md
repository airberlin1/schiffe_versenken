# Start Menu
# Start
Starts the game with previously set settings. The User can now decide, whether they want to set the ships by themselves, have the ships set randomly, or if they want to load a saved game.

## Difficulty
As of now, there are 4 difficulties to chose from. The easy enemy will target spots on the board randomly, the medium enemy will try to destroy a ship as soon as one was found, the hard enemy will do the same, but require less moves to accomplish that, and the impossible enemy hits every single shot.
The difficulty can only be set before the game starts.

## Looks/Screen
The game can be played in a window or in full screen, and the background as well as the color of the buttons can be adjusted.

## Language
The game can be played in 3 different languages, German, English and Latin. Note that Latin might have texts/words that would normally not be used in the context they are used here.

# Ship placement
The ships can be placed on the board by dragging them to their new location. To turn the ships, use 'a' and 'd' or the arrow keys. Ships that have not yet been set appear to the right of the board.

# In-game
The game can be played with the mouse as well as with a keyboard. To play with the mouse, klick on a spot on the board to chose that spot, then click again to shoot it. With the keyboard, type a spot on the board, such as a2, and press enter/return. Note that there won't be any visual typing.
The game can also be saved by pressing the save button.
